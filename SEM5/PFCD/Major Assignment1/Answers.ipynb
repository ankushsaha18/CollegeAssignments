    "### Q1. Write a Python function basic salary that accepts two parameters: hourly rate and hours worked per week. The function should calculate the basic salary per month (assuming a month has 4 weeks). If the hours worked per week exceed 40, create another function overtime salary, where every extra hour worked is paid at 1.5 times the normal hourly rate. Finally, create another function total salary that returns the sum of the basic salary and overtime."
